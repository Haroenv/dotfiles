Features

Almost all you need to DEVELOP HARDER!

Zsh
===
- Explicit aliases!

(Mac)Vim
===
- use `,f` to open a file tree
- use `ctrl` with `hjkl` to move from buffer to buffer

Git
===
- Super fast aliases (see `git/aliases`)
- A couple of nice shortcuts:
  - `gac "my commit message"` to add all and commit
  - `gunc` to uncommit
  - `guns` to unstage
- My personal favorites:
  - `gplr` for `git pull --rebase`
  - `gps` to push
  - `gri` fo `git rebase -i`
